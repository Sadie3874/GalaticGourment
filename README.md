This is a Manitoba Trades and Technologies (MITT) assignment for the course Database Integration and ORM Concepts. This repository is posted for my portfolio for my application to the Red River Game development program. Please note the Program.cs file is not my code but the code given to use to test our queries. Everything else is my code or has been automatically generated by installed Visual Studio Packages, My code is commented to explain what is happening. Thank you.
